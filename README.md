#Gas-Leakage-Detection-System

This project represents my graduation project, which is centered around the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.

The primary objective of our project is to enhance public safety by implementing an automated system that promptly detects gas leaks, alerts individuals, and takes appropriate actions utilizing IoT technology.

To achieve this goal, we employed several hardware components, including the ESP32 microcontroller, MQ2 gas sensor, LED lights, a buzzer, and CPU fans.

In terms of software, we utilized the Blynk App and the Twilio platform to enable seamless communication and coordination within the system.

By integrating these components and software tools, our Gas Leakage Detection System serves as an effective and efficient solution for mitigating the risks associated with gas leaks and ensuring the well-being of individuals in various environments.
